the attempt to write about the frustrations keeping me awake at night

# Raymonds 

It's August 1st - 4am in the morning and I cannot turn my thoughts off since leaving the worst night of work at Raymonds in my almost three years of being their employee. 
A lot of bad character moments happen nightly at Raymonds behind the scenes. Attitudes come out and the stress reveals the worst in a lot of the staff - myself included. Typically by the end of the night we are exhausted, but peace is made and there is a sense of friendship from surviving another service. That despite the stress and frustrations, we are a team and are proud to have offered an experience of excellent Newfoundland food and hospitality.

This summer - 2019 is missing the mark entirely. Something has changed in the attitude and atmosphere of the place. The experience is no longer the goal - bringing in money has replaced it as the most important role of staff and service. Greed plagues every move.

Open 7 days a week. Additional tables squeezed beside eachother and changing the comfort for guest and server in the dinning room. Cheaper wine, higher prices and pressure to limit sizes or ingridents. Tension is higher than usual and everyone is feeling burnt out or taken advantage of. All of this for what? Covers are incredibly low and tips are not even close to the previous years. Guests are sensing it and not feeling cared for well at the end of the night - especially those who knew it from years past.

It came to a head this evening. Cracked. 

The night was fairly regular, until it became clear that daytime duties had been poorly done and corners had been cut. Glasses with lipstick stains were coming back from tables set during the day, water spots on cutlery, uneven table cloths, deatiling had been neglected and reservation sheets inconsistanties. All of these added up to an unending rush that lasted the entire night. We needed to switch into a higher gear, but our clutch wasn't working. 

The noise was growing and food was being rushed out from the servery. A tasting here, needs pairing, 7 course, 3 VPDJs, 1 Halli, sunflower allergy, it's not cucumber it's zucchini. 

"I need a 3 course VPDJ; this is a tasting size." 

"Shit - someone just took that out by accident. Call down to get an app sized one on the fly." 

That's it, a normal mistake when the rush is on. Hot food flys from those shelves - grabing the bowl with 5 noodles instead of 3 is very easy to do. Especially with a young 19 year old who has only been on this pass alone for 3-4 shifts now. While incredibly capable and smart - of course these fast paced moments to slow a more experienced server down as they grab plates is not a natural reflect just yet. 

Practicing communicating over a small phone in a loud servery with 4 people talking to the mistake is difficult. Being clear is difficult with 2 people looking for your attention at the same time.

PHONE SMASHES - a pause and nervousness creeps. I think I said that right? 
...
1 inch away from her face "NO LITTLE LADY - DON'T BE SNIPPY WITH ME! (attempts to appolog......) SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!" the chef de cuisine YELLS at her in rage. leaves in a huff. 

The room fills with this moment. At least 3 of us women realize what just happened. Froze.
